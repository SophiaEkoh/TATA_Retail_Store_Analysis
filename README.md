# TATA_Retail_Store_Analysis
AN online retail store is known for distributing various goods across different countries. This project focused on identifying the factors contributing to the positive performance of the store. My role as a data analyst involved understanding the data, cleaning, analysis and creating the right visuals.

## Data cleaning
This involved the removal of duplicate values and blanks, formatting values appropriately and generating calculated columns.

### Exploratory data analysis
Various questions asked by the CEO and CMO of the business all aimed to determine the major contributing factors to the revenue so they can strategically plan for the next year. All these could be discovered by 
- observing seasonal trends
- viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue and 
- identifying the top 10 customers by revenue
